ðŸ›’ RetailRocket Hybrid Recommender System

This project implements a production-grade recommendation engine using the RetailRocket dataset.
It combines Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, and a Learning-to-Rank (LTR) model to deliver personalized product recommendations through a FastAPI service.

ðŸ”¥ Key Technologies Used
	â€¢	FastAPI â€” Lightweight API serving
	â€¢	LightGBM â€” LambdaRank Learning-to-Rank model
	â€¢	FAISS â€” Approximate nearest neighbor search for content-based retrieval
	â€¢	Scikit-learn â€” SVD dimensionality reduction
	â€¢	Docker â€” Containerized deployment
	â€¢	Python 3.10 â€” Development environment
	â€¢	RetailRocket Dataset â€” Real-world e-commerce data


ðŸŽ¯ Future Improvements
	â€¢	Add A/B testing framework for model comparison.
	â€¢	Implement online feature store for real-time inference.
	â€¢	Integrate more metadata into content-based modeling.
	â€¢	Explore Neural Collaborative Filtering or Transformers for improved recommendations.
